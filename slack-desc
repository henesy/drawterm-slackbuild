drawterm: drawterm -- utility for connecting to Plan 9 and 9front systems.
drawterm:
drawterm: Drawterm is a program which attempts to emulate various portions of
drawterm: a 9front kernel and summarily connect to a 9front cpu and auth
drawterm: server. 9front's fork of drawterm adds support for 9front's refined
drawterm: authentication protocol, but can authenticate with less secure
drawterm: Plan 9 systems using p9sk1.
